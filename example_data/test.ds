// NOTE: This format allows things to be tagged with @'s, which
// are to be immediately followed by strings. These tags terminate
// on whitespace. These are used to annotate structures. These tags
// can be introspected upon by custom code, and are included in
// parse information. The following tag marks the struct following it
// as "Printable", which makes the example custom layer generate a
// print function for it.
@Printable

// NOTE: Structs work similarly to how they do in C. It's just a
// package of data. A struct contains declarations which outline
// the format of the data structure. The format for declarations
// differs from C in that it has the following pattern:
// <identifier> : <type>. Array specifiers are not an attribute of
// a declaration, but rather of the type, so to declare an array
// of i32's(32-bit integers), you'd do: array : i32[5];. To add
// a layer of indirection to make something a pointer, prefix the
// type with a number of *'s, e.g.: array : *i32[5];.
struct TestStruct
{
    a : i32;
    b : f32;
    c : char;
    
    // NOTE: Individual declarations can also be tagged. The following
    // tag, NoPrint, signifies to the example custom layer that this
    // member is not to be included in the printing function.
    @NoPrint d: *f32[SOME_CONSTANT];
